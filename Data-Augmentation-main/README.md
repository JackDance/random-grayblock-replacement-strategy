# An Effective Data Augmentation for person re-identification
Code for paper : An Effective Data Augmentation for person re-identification(https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08533). 

By the way, we have implemented a good adversarial defense method of Reid on this basis (see another paper for details:A Person Re-identification Data Augmentation Method with Adversarial Defense Effect(https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08783, the code is available at:https://github.com/finger-monkey/ReID_Adversarial_Defense))

By providing this code, you can simply verify the validity of the method proposed in the paper.

The baselines we use are the ReID_baseline[10]（see the paper） that the author of CVPR2019 paper [8] opened in the early stage, the strong baseline [1] and FastReID which were recently open sourced by one of the main authors in [1] . We have conducted experiments on three of the largest and most representative datasets, Market-1501[13], DukeMTMC[14], and MSMT17[16], and our method has significantly improved on all three of these baselines. Since the model requires more training epochs to fit than the original, we add 0.5-1.5 times more training epochs to the training process.

###########Use ReID_baseline to simply verify the effectiveness of our method##################

download the code from the ReID_baseline, and then just do as follow:

(1)download our file 'trans_gray.py' and put it together with the code of ReID_baseline

(2)add the code between lines 23-24 of 'train.py' file:  'from trans_gray import *' 

(3)add the code between lines 76-77 of 'train.py' file:'transforms.RandomGrayscale(0.05)' or 'RGTP(0.4)'

(4) change parameter 'num_epochs' to 120 on line 386, 

(5)and use command 'python train.py --train_all' to train according to the tutorial provided by author,finally use 'test.py' to test.

The author’s training accuracy is: r-1:88.84, mAP:71.59. 
You can also set 'transforms.RandomGrayscale(1)' in lines 76-77 and lines 83-84 verify that the contribution of grayscale information to the query task.
